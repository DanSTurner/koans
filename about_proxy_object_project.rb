# Project: Create a Proxy Class
#
# In this assignment, create a proxy class (one is started for you
# below).  You should be able to initialize the proxy object with any
# object.  Any messages sent to the proxy object should be forwarded
# to the target object.  As each message is sent, the proxy should
# record the name of the method sent.
#
# The proxy class is started for you.  You will need to add a method
# missing handler and any other supporting methods.  The specification
# of the Proxy class is given in the AboutProxyObjectProject koan.

class Proxy
  def initialize(target_object)
    @object = target_object      # allow passing of methods which are missing
    @messages_sent = Hash.new(0) # create hash to hold messages (methods) and how many times called, starting at zero
  end

  def method_missing(method_name, *args, &block)
      @messages_sent[method_name] += 1              # increment values for each method name stored in the hash where the method doesn't exist
      @object.__send__(method_name, *args, &block)  # return missing methods
  end
  
  def messages
    @messages_sent.keys                             # return the methods which have been called through the proxy
  end

  def called?(method_name)
    messages.include?(method_name)                  # check if the results of the previous method (messages) include whatever message name
  end

  def number_of_times_called(method_name)
    @messages_sent[method_name]                     # return the value for the key (the method name which had been called)
  end

#
